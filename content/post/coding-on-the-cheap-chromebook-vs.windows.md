Being a father of two, the only free time I have is at night, when everyone else is asleep (around 11PM). I have to admit, the past few years, I felt exhausted everyday and didn't have the energy to start working on personal projects late at night; I used that time to just relax and do nothing productive instead.

Lately, I guess I got used to the routine, and found the will to work on personal projects again. The thing is, I'm usually in my bed at that time, so I needed a laptop. I wanted something cheap, thin, light, with a good battery life, and ideally fanless. My initial goal was to use it as some kind of "thin client", i.e. using it to remote into my desktop with AnyDesk. So the specs didn't matter much to me, as long as it had a 1080p screen.

I already had two laptops at home: a Microsoft Surface Laptop that was provided by my employer. I hate it; the fan is whining all the time, it gets very hot, and the battery life's sad. I also have an old Thinkpad X1 Yoga 1st gen from 2017 that I used in college. It wasn't bad for its time, but the battery can now barely hold a charge, and I remember the thermals weren't great. Now, it's just plugged in my garage, mining some moneros.

So a few weeks ago, I bought the cheapest laptop I could find, fitting the criteria I mentioned earlier. I settled on a Samsung Galaxy Book Go 14 for $200 CAD (Snapdragon 7c Gen 2, 4gb ram, 128gb SSD, fanless). While this laptop packed a lot for its price, I ended up returning it. At first, it did its job nicely at remote controlling my desktop PC. AnyDesk is great for that; there's barely any lag, and the full screen mode feels like you're using the host machine directly. However, a few hours, I noticed the laptop's screen was just awful. Although it was an full HD screen, it wasn't an IPS one and the viewing angles were just awful. Furthermore, the touchpad had an issue where it would frequently become irresponsive. I searched online, and this seems to be a common issue with Samsung laptops nowadays.

So sadly, I had to return it. I was disappointed, because the laptop's form factor was great, and the battery life was very good as well. This made me realize that the screen quality should be one of my main criteria of selecting a laptop. It also made me reconsider my initial goal, which was to find a machine that would solely enable me to remote into my desktop PC. While using the Samsung Galaxy Go, I realized that, although the AnyDesk experience was great, it didn't feel quite the same as actually using a computer directly. This manifested primarily when watching videos, scrolling contents on the web, or when trying to use gestures with the trackpad. All those small things made the experience uncanny. So I updated my goal: I wanted a laptop that I'd use for development, not just for remoting into another computer. Being a cheapskate though, I still wanted to pay the minimum, like less than $350 CAD ideally.

I shopped around for days, nothing would fit all my criteria. I started to look into Chromebooks. I knew about their existence, but I always thought they were bad and couldn't be used for development. I was so wrong. Nowadays, Linux and Linux apps can easily be installed on a Chromebook. Chromebooks are also generally much cheaper than Windows laptops as well, since they don't come with a Windows license.

So I was eyeing an open-box Lenovo Chromebook on eBay for like $150 CAD (oh my god, I'm terribly frugal), but I couldn't commit, because I had never used a Chromebook before, and things are sometimes hard to return when bought on eBay. I looked around, and it turns out that there are a few options to install Chrome OS on a regular computer. [Brunch](https://github.com/sebanc/brunch) seems to be one of them. That made me dig out my old Thinkpad, shut down the Monero miner, and install Chrome OS on a partition to test it out.
